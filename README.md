# JIT

Jira + Git

CLI tool for repo task management.

Version control your tasks!

# Overview
Minimialist vibe of task management.
Basically, instead of relying on a task/project manager tools
that have many buttons, and many links, and many UI/UX...
use a basic cli command that version controls tasks alongside your git repo.

All task data is stored in a `.jit` directory that sits side by 
side your `.git` directory of the project you want to manage tasks for.

My motivation for this was to manage tasks for barebone git repositories in my homelab. 
I will be building jit based off that usecase.
